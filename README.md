## Security Considerations
- API keys are securely stored as environment variables.
- Authentication is handled via OAuth with secure token storage.
- CORS headers are properly configured for API security.
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse.
- User content is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

---

## Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting and lazy loading for faster initial load.
- Static generation for non-dynamic pages.
- Optimized image loading and processing.
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders.
- Edge caching for API responses where appropriate.
